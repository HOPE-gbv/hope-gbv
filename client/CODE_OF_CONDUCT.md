## Scope of This Code

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, associated social media, communication channels, events, and any other forums created by the project team. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at conduct@example.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Specific Guidelines for This Project

Given the sensitive nature of our work addressing gender-based violence:

### Privacy and Confidentiality

* Never share any user data or case information in public repositories or discussions
* Be extremely careful when discussing features that could impact user privacy or safety
* Consider the security implications of all code changes

### Trauma-Informed Approach

* Understand that contributors may include survivors
* Be mindful that discussions about feature implementation may be triggering for some
* Approach design decisions with awareness of how they might impact vulnerable users

### Language and Communication

* Use inclusive, non-gendered language when possible
* Avoid assumptions about gender, sexuality, or experiences of violence
* Use content warnings when discussing potentially triggering topics

### Technical Decisions

* Prioritize user safety over feature richness
* Consider accessibility from the beginning
* Design with the most vulnerable users in mind
